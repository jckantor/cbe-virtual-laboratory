    "\n",
    "MQTT is a lightweight protocol for delivering messages between devices through an intermediate broker. Senders declare a 'topic' and 'publish' messages to the broker. Receivers 'subscribe' to particular topics on the broker to receive a copy of all messages pertaining to that topic. Connections between a device and broker are typically over a TCP/IP network, but other transport mediums are in common use. This robust and flexible 'hub-and-spoke' architecture has been widely adopted for 'Internet of Things' (IoT) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MQTT acronym was orginally an abbreviation for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport that was developed by individuals at IBM and Cirrus Link (later Eurotech) for monitoring pipeline by satellite in remote locations. IBM later submitted the protocol to the global standards body, OASIS and ISO, where they are now maintained as open standards."
